Features
  - STEP UP (Partial)
  - SKILL ANALYZER
  - EVENT (Partial)
  - ARENA (LOCAL only)
  - RANDOME LANE TICKET
  - FAVORITE/SONG SELECTION NOTES
  - ORIGINAL FILTER
  - HIT CHART (Sparkle Shower, from the plays this server records)
  - CUSTOMIZE PICKERS (EPOLIS, Pinky Crush, Sparkle Shower): the Settings tab lists each version's
    own items, and each item, QPro part and entry background can be chosen from its picture after
    that version's pictures are imported on the Customize Images page (the browser reads the game's
    data/graphic folder and sends only the pictures; the plugin ships no game images)
  - MASTER AND DISCIPLE BINGO (Sparkle Shower): cards made each week from the song list, at the
    difficulty the player clears (see Difficulty Tables)

Difficulty Tables

data/difficulty.json is a snapshot (2026-09-27) of the players' difficulty tables below, matched
to the game's music ids; bingo cards use it to choose charts, and the Difficulty Tables page changes
ranks over it (or gives new songs one). The ranks are the work of those tables' authors and voters:
  - SP☆12 normal / hard clear reference tables ("☆12参考表"):
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSUdp6iuEzE8Z5AL1hkoxzLexp89nJnLQMmICm6_MC0_UjCp1ImZFzabcZkvCpK7mcWvm_2t6iYoJRg/pubhtml
  - SP☆11 normal / hard clear difficulty tables (the atwiki archive of 2025-02-22, read through
    iidx-difficulty-table-checker.nomadblacky.dev): https://w.atwiki.jp/bemani2sp11/
  - DP unofficial difficulty table (SNJ@KMZS): https://zasa.sakura.ne.jp/dp/

Known Issues

  - SUPER FUTURE 2323 play records doesn't display on other version due to missing conversion code
  - ONE MORE EXTRA STAGE progress won't save (can't test this due to skill issue)
  - DOUBLE PLAY or two persons play may not work properly (can't test this due to skill issue)
  - New card cannot be registered before DistorteD (this is due to those games uses magnetic card)
  - Some of licensed songs are locked behind (kinda solved with music\_open but needs to be verified)
